## bst files for bibliographies

Citations are meant to be as (Borrelli, 2020) in the text. Use with the natbib package. All of the authors are listed in the biblography, last name first.

**neup.bst** should be used for a white paper or preproposal, where space is limited. Pair with the white paper template in this repository. References are listed in the order of appearance in the bib file. Citations are meant to be as [1] in the text to save space. Use with the natbib package. Only first author is listed in the bibliography, last name first, then with 'et al.'
